	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that has a lower time complexity, meaning it takes less time to execute.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. It is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the size of the input data.</p>
